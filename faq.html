      <h1>FAQ</h1>

      <h2>Why use Downward instead of another calorie counter?</h2>
      <p>It's optimized for speed and it runs locally without an internet connection or online account. There are no ads, upsells, or paywalls.</p>

      <h2>Can I use it to maintain or gain weight?</h2>
      <p>Absolutely. I called it "Downward" because, let's be honest, most of us are trying to lose weight, but you can set whatever goals you want.</p>

      <h2>Why is it free?</h2>
      <p>I don't need the money. This was part passion project, and part learning project. I formed an LLC for it because I don't want to get personally sued by somebody who decided not to eat a healthy diet as a result of flawed data or flawed settings or bugs in the app. I do my best to make the app great (I use it myself, after all), but I'm not a doctor and no app is perfect — I'm sure there's a hidden bug or flawed food data, especially in the Open Food Facts DB since that is an open source project.</p>

      <h2>Are you going to maintain it?</h2>
      <p>Yes, and please <a href="mailto:support@downwardtrajectory.com">email me via the support link</a> if you have any bugs or requests. But I won't be adding a ton of new features. If the app really takes off, I'd consider adding new features behind a subscription paywall because app development takes time. So if you email me with a feature request, let me know how much you'd be willing to pay for a subscription service ;).</p>
