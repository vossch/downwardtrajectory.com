      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="effective-date">Effective date: February 24, 2026</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Downward stores all data locally on your device. No personal data is transmitted to or stored on external servers operated by us. There is no account, no sign-in, and no cloud sync.</p>

      <h2>Data we collect</h2>
      <p>None. Downward does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. There is no analytics, no telemetry, and no crash reporting that sends data off-device.</p>

      <h2>Data stored on your device</h2>
      <p>The following information is stored locally on your iPhone using iOS local storage (SwiftData) and never leaves your device unless you have iCloud Backup enabled (see below):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Food log entries (foods logged, quantities, dates)</li>
        <li>Weight entries</li>
        <li>Profile settings (units, height, weight, sex, activity level)</li>
        <li>Goal settings (goal weight, weekly rate, calorie and macro targets)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Deleting the app removes all locally stored data.</p>

      <h2>iCloud Backup</h2>
      <p>If you have iCloud Backup enabled in your iOS settings, app data may be included in your iCloud backup. This backup is managed entirely by Apple and subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. We have no access to your iCloud backup. You can exclude Downward from iCloud Backup in <strong>Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Manage Storage → Backups</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>Downward optionally uses the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenFoodFacts</a> online API as a fallback when local food search returns no results. When this occurs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only the search query string (the food name you typed) is transmitted</li>
        <li>No personal information is included in the request</li>
        <li>This call only happens when local search finds nothing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OpenFoodFacts is an open-source, non-profit food database. Their privacy policy is available at <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world.openfoodfacts.org/privacy</a>.</p>

      <h2>Bundled database</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDA FoodData Central</a> database (nearly half a million foods) is included in the app bundle at install time. No network requests are made to access this data — food search works entirely offline.</p>

      <h2>Apple and the App Store</h2>
      <p>Downward is distributed through the Apple App Store. Apple may independently collect data about your device and App Store activity in accordance with <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. We have no access to or control over data Apple collects.</p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>Because we do not collect or store any personal data on external servers, there is no data held by us to access, correct, or delete. All your data lives on your device under your control. You can delete all data at any time by deleting the app. If you have questions or concerns about your privacy, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@downwardtrajectory.com">support@downwardtrajectory.com</a>.</p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>Downward is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be posted to this page with a revised effective date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
