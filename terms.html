      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="effective-date">Effective date: February 24, 2026</p>

      <h2>Agreement</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Use govern your use of the Downward iOS application ("the app"). By downloading or using the app, you agree to these terms. This agreement is between you and the developer of Downward — not Apple. Apple is not responsible for the app or its content.</p>

      <h2>License</h2>
      <p>You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the app on any Apple-branded device you own or control, as permitted by the App Store Terms of Service. You may not copy, modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, or distribute the app or any part of it.</p>

      <h2>Health and medical disclaimer</h2>
      <p>Downward is for informational purposes only. It is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition. Using the app does not create a doctor-patient or any other professional relationship.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calorie and macro calculations are estimates only.</li>
        <li>Calorie and macro values on foods may be incorrect.</li>
        <li>Consult a qualified healthcare provider before starting any diet or making significant changes to your eating habits, especially if you have or suspect a medical condition.</li>
        <li>This app is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data accuracy</h2>
      <p>Nutritional data is sourced from the <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDA FoodData Central</a> database bundled with the app, and optionally from the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenFoodFacts</a> online database as a fallback. This data is provided by third parties and may contain errors or omissions. We do not guarantee its accuracy or completeness. You assume all risk from reliance on nutritional information provided by the app.</p>

      <h2>Your data</h2>
      <p>All data you enter — food logs, weight entries, profile settings, and goals — is stored locally on your device. We do not collect or transmit your personal information. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>

      <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>The app, including its design, code, and content, is owned by the developer of Downward and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws. These terms do not transfer any ownership rights to you.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
      <p>The app is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not warrant that the app will be error-free, uninterrupted, or meet your specific requirements.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer of Downward shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of or inability to use the app, including but not limited to loss of data or reliance on inaccurate nutritional information.</p>

      <h2>Future changes to the app</h2>
      <p>Downward is currently free with no account required and all data stored locally. We may choose to add paid features or tiers in the future, which may require account creation or cloud data storage. We will not make any such changes without your explicit consent.</p>

      <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>
      <p>These terms may change. If they do, the updated version will be posted to this page with a revised effective date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

      <h2>Governing law</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the United States. Any disputes shall first be addressed through good-faith negotiation. If unresolved, disputes shall be handled in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

      <h2>Apple as third-party beneficiary</h2>
      <p>Apple Inc. and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these terms. Upon your acceptance, Apple has the right to enforce these terms against you as a third-party beneficiary.</p>
